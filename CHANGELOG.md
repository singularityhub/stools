# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release.
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. All closed issued and bug fixes should be 
represented by the pull requests that fixed them. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes (recipe file format? image file format?)
 - migration guidance (how to convert images?)
 - changed behaviour (recipe sections work differently)


## [v1.x](https://github.com/singularityhub/stools/tree/master) (master)
 - bumping aiohttp version (0.0.13)
 - Adding generation of reports to folder with --reports (0.0.12)
 - Original release of stools, primarily will be used with the docker-compose.yml (0.0.1)
